<h1>jamliterate</h1>

Jamliterate is an educational web application that generates study flashcards from any text.

This application was built with Python and the web framework Flask. "main.py" contains the Python code that dictates the general functionality of the app. The "templates" directory contains all the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that fabricate the appearance and interactivity of the app. Additional files ("requirements.txt" and "render.yaml") are necessary to deploy this web app on Render.
